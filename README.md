# Pyramid-Generator
Just as the name implies, this is a mini project of a pyramid generator in different languages. 
# WHY I BUILT THIS : 
I saw this project first on free code camp, however i only saw but couldn't do. So this was just to make sure i can do. 
To practice nested loops, spacing logic, and algorithmic pattern generation in C and other languages.
